Select * /[DISTININCT] Column_name/Expression[ALIAS]FROM table_Name;
wxpression combination of operator and operatora

Select sal*6 from emp;
select sal,sal+(sal*10), sal*12 from emp;

alternative name given to a colum or expressiom in the result table
it can be used with or without AS keyword.
ALIAS names should be single word or it should be enclosed with in double quotes or we can use underscore if it is having multiple words.
-- SELECT sal*12 "ANNUAL_SALARY" FROM emp;
-- SELECT sal*10 AS a FROM emp;
-- select ename as name, sal*12 as annual, sal*0.30 as incrimentedSal from emp;

DISTININCT
Dinstinct is a clause which is used to remove duplicated or repeated values from the table
for Dinstinct clause we can pass col name, or expession as argument
we can pass distinct clause as the first clause as a fist argument.
should always be passed as FIRST argument;
-- SELECT DISTININCT sal,marks from emp;
-- SELECT sal,DISTININCT marks from emp; THIS IS WRONG always as first arg
-- SELECT DISTININCT sal,marks from emp; in this it will check combination of both sal, marks both should be equal in a row then only it will give one;


SELECT and WHERE are row clause

WHERE

SELECT *[Dinstinct]Column_name/Expression[ALIAS] FROM table_Name;
executes row by row
