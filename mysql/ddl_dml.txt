Select * /[DISTININCT] Column_name/Expression[ALIAS]FROM table_Name;
wxpression combination of operator and operatora

Select sal*6 from emp;
select sal,sal+(sal*10), sal*12 from emp;

alternative name given to a colum or expressiom in the result table
it can be used with or without AS keyword.
ALIAS names should be single word or it should be enclosed with in double quotes or we can use underscore if it is having multiple words.
-- SELECT sal*12 "ANNUAL_SALARY" FROM emp;
-- SELECT sal*10 AS a FROM emp;
-- select ename as name, sal*12 as annual, sal*0.30 as incrimentedSal from emp;

DISTININCT
Dinstinct is a clause which is used to remove duplicated or repeated values from the table
for Dinstinct clause we can pass col name, or expession as argument
we can pass distinct clause as the first clause as a fist argument.
should always be passed as FIRST argument;
-- SELECT DISTININCT sal,marks from emp;
-- SELECT sal,DISTININCT marks from emp; THIS IS WRONG always as first arg
-- SELECT DISTININCT sal,marks from emp; in this it will check combination of both sal, marks both should be equal in a row then only it will give one;


SELECT and WHERE are row clause

WHERE

SELECT *[Dinstinct]Column_name/Expression[ALIAS] FROM table_Name;
executes row by row

#operators 
Artithmatic op(+-*/);
relational operator(<>>= <=);
logical operator(And,or,NOT);
comparison operator(=,!=,<>);
special operators(int, not in, between, not between,is not, like, not like);
subqueru operator(ACC,  ANY, EXISTS, NOT EXISTS);
concatination op(||);

AND op - it is used when we want to satisgy all the conditions
OR-op used to satisfy any one of the condition
NOT - negate/inverse am condition, eg: select * from emp where sal >2000 and not job = 'manager';
    -eg : select * from emp where NOT( job = 'manager' or job ='salesman') and sal*12 <15000 ;

IN - it is a multivalue operator which used to accept multiple values at RHS, similar to equals operator, returns true if it satisfy any one of the values at RHS

NOT IN- similar to in op instead of accepting, it will reject the values
BETWEEN - in is used whenever we have range of values. it works by including the given range, 
          we can-not interchange the range of values
